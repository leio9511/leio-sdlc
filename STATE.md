# STATE.md - leio-sdlc Development State (Kanban)

- **Project**: leio-sdlc (Automated SDLC Orchestrator)
- **Current Version**: 0.8.3
- **Status**: [SDLC Hardening] - Implementing native notifications, fail-fast git hygiene, and deterministic state tracking.
- **Active Branch**: `master`

## 🏆 Recently Completed
- [x] **[ISSUE-1058] Prevent SDLC_TEST_MODE Leakage in Production**: Added context-aware guardrails to `orchestrator.py` to fatally terminate if `SDLC_TEST_MODE=true` is detected in the production runtime, physically blocking hallucinated mock approvals.

Downgraded Auditor from independent AgentSkill to internal native script to physically eradicate Reward Hacking bypasses.

- [x] **[ISSUE-1039] PRD-1039 v11: Automated Orchestrator Cleanup Forensic Quarantine**: Implemented crash-proof process group isolation and lock-aware `--cleanup` flag for robust agent teardown. (v0.8.0)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1036] PRD-033: SDLC Observability & Ignition Guardrail**: Implemented mandatory ignition handshake, real-time Slack intermediate pulses (Coder/Reviewer/Merge), and full migration of the review protocol from `[LGTM]` string matching to structured JSON parsing. (v0.7.0)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1026/1033] PRD-032 v2: Strict Execution Boundary**: Enforced `~/.openclaw/skills/` as the only allowed runtime directory. Blocking source code execution from the workspace unless `--enable-exec-from-workspace` is provided. (v0.6.1)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1025] PRD-1025: Reviewer LGTM Bypass**: Refactored orchestrator to parse strict JSON status and physically isolated history diffs in reviewer prompt.
- [x] **[ISSUE-1018] PRD-1018: Enforce Channel Parameter**: Orchestrator now strictly requires --channel and fails-fast on missing notification target. (v0.5.5)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1015] PRD-1015: Hard-Copy Deployment Strategy**: Replaced symlink Blue/Green deploy with atomic directory swapping for AgentSkills. (v0.5.4)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1019] PRD-1019: Clean Workspace Escalation**: Git reset --hard and clean -fd on State 5 Tier 1 recovery. (v0.5.3)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1010] PRD-1010: Orchestrator Self-Explanation**: Enforced strict CLI parameters and implemented the 5 Tool-as-Prompt handoff exit points. (v0.5.2)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1011 & 1012] PRD-1011: Global Lock & Deadlock Fix**: Implemented fcntl global singleton lock and resolved the reviewer guardrail deadlock. (v0.5.1)
- [x] **[ISSUE-067] Migrate SDLC to Gemini ACP**: Coder now uses persistent sandboxed ACP sessions via openclaw agent CLI.
- [x] **[ISSUE-054] State 0: PRD Ingestion & Auto-Slicing**: Orchestrator can now accept a raw PRD and automatically trigger the Planner.
- [x] **[ISSUE-1010] PRD-1010: Orchestrator Self-Explanation**: Enforced strict CLI parameters and implemented the 5 Tool-as-Prompt handoff exit points. (v0.5.2)
- [x] **[ISSUE-1007] PRD-079: SDLC Slack Notifications & Git Hygiene**: Native channel broadcast and Semantic Commit Enforcement. (v0.4.0)
- [x] **[ISSUE-077] CLI Command Mismatch for ACP**: Replaced internal Tool APIs with valid OpenClaw CLI commands (`openclaw agent --session-id`).
- [x] **[ISSUE-074] Information Silo & Dependency Injection**: Orchestrator now serves as Single Source of Truth for Review Report artifact paths.
- [x] **[ISSUE-075] Robust Git State Management**: Implemented `safe_git_checkout` and automatic explicit state commits, eliminating dirty-tree branch crashes.
- [x] **[ISSUE-064] Anti-Reward Hacking Isolation (PRD-064)**: Refactored `orchestrator.py` to use `__file__` absolute paths (`RUNTIME_DIR`), physically preventing the Coder from hijacking the testing framework or Reviewer via relative path execution from the workspace. (v0.2.6)
- [x] **[ISSUE-063] Planner Micro-Slicing & Test Fixes**: Resolves issue tracker/artifact hang bugs. (v0.2.5)
- [x] **[ISSUE-057] PR Directory Isolation by PRD**: Micro-PRs are now physically isolated in `docs/PRs/<PRD_Name>/`. Engine processes isolated queues flawlessly.
